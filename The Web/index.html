        <h2>Getting the Lay of the Land</h2>
        <p>Back in 1989 Tim Berners-Lee of the European Particle Physics Laboratory (CERN) wrote an innocent little document entitled
            Information Management. A Proposal that, among other things, outlined the development of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
            Little did he realize that the modest 18-page document would forever change the way in which we access, acquire, and share information. 
            HTML caught on like widefire. By July of 1993, there were hundred of computers worldwide that could deliver HTML documents.
            Up until that point, however, the majority of people in on this exciting new technology were academics and hard-core computer
            users.

            <h2>THE WORLD WIDE WEB</h2>
            <p>
                The original purpose of the World Wide Web (WWW) was to locate and display information. However, once the Web grew beyond a small academic and
                scientific communtiy, people began to recognize that greater interactivity would make the Web more useful. As commercial applications of the Web
                grew, the demand for more interactive and visually appealing Websites also grew. A Website is simply a collection of 
                Web pages with any supporting files (such as GIF or JPG graphics). Creating a Website thus involves creating one or 
                more pages and linking them. The Website is then saved on a Web server. 
                A common misconception is that the word "Web" and "Interntet" are synonymous. People thought the Web and Internet are the 
                same thing! However the Web is only one part of the Internet, and is a means of communicating on the Internet.

                <h2>Domain Name System</h2>
                <p>
                    DNS as the name implies is a mechanism that maps host names to IP addresses. As you know the from browsing the web, you rarely specify IP addresses directly. 
                    You do however specify a host name such as www.example.com. If hosts are identified by IP addresses how does your browser know which 
                    Web server to contact if you specify a host name? The answer is the DNS Server. When you specify the destination 
                    address of www.example.com your browser might already know the IP address of the website, it uses a stub resolver a 
                    component of the operating system that handles DNS name resolution for applications running on devices such as computers, 
                    smartphones, or other internet-connected devices. The stub resolver stores a cache which contains a list of IP address 
                    for safe keeping and easy routing to websites you have recently visited. A stub resolver is a partial DNS resolver
                    that depends on a recursive DNS resolver to complete the resolution process. The recursive resolver takes over from 
                    the stub resolver. It performs the heavy lifting of querying other DNS servers (such as root servers, TLD servers, 
                    and authoritative servers) to fully resolve the domain name into an IP address. It then sends the final answer back 
                    to the stub resolver, which passes it to the requesting application.

                        <h1>The Internet</h1>
                        <p>The Internet developed over 60 years through a combination of research, innovation, collaboration, and scaling, evolving from a military research project to the <br>global network we use today. 
                            <br>
                            <br>Here’s a simplified timeline:
                            <br>1. 1950s-1960s: Foundation and Early Research
                            Concepts Introduced: Early ideas of packet switching and decentralized networks emerged. Researchers like Paul Baran and Donald Davies proposed ways to transmit data in small packets for efficiency and reliability.
                            ARPANET: Funded by the U.S. Department of Defense's ARPA, ARPANET was created in 1969 as the first operational network connecting multiple computers. <br>
                            <br>2. 1970s: Protocols and Expansion
                            TCP/IP Protocols: Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn developed the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) in 1974, enabling computers on different networks to communicate seamlessly.
                            Email Introduced: Ray Tomlinson created the first email system in 1971, revolutionizing communication.
                            Networking Growth: ARPANET expanded and connected more institutions, primarily universities and research centers. <br>
                            <br>3. 1980s: Standardization and Wider Adoption
                            DNS: The Domain Name System (DNS) was created in 1983, making it easier to navigate the Internet using names (like "example.com") instead of numerical IP addresses.
                            Commercial Networks: Networks like CSNET and NSFNET started connecting businesses and institutions, expanding beyond military and academic use.
                            TCP/IP Adoption: TCP/IP became the standard for all networks, setting the stage for a global Internet. <br>
                            <br>4. 1990s: The World Wide Web and Public Use
                            WWW Invented: Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1991, introducing web pages, URLs, and browsers.
                            Commercialization: The Internet became accessible to the public through ISPs (Internet Service Providers), with graphical browsers like Mosaic (1993) and Netscape (1994) making it user-friendly.
                            Search Engines: Early search engines like Yahoo! and Google (1998) began organizing the growing web. <br>
                            <br>5. 2000s: Global Expansion and Web 2.0
                            Broadband: Faster Internet connections (DSL, cable, fiber) became widespread.
                            Web 2.0: User-generated content and interactivity flourished with platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Wikipedia.
                            Mobile Internet: Smartphones brought the Internet to everyone’s pocket, with apps and mobile-friendly websites. <br>
                            <br>6. 2010s-2020s: Ubiquity and Innovation
                            Cloud Computing: Services like AWS and Google Cloud transformed how data is stored and accessed.
                            Streaming and Social Media: Platforms like Netflix, TikTok, and Instagram reshaped entertainment and communication.
                            IoT and 5G: The Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G networks connected billions of devices, from smart homes to cars.
                            AI and Blockchain: Emerging technologies began shaping the Internet’s future, enabling smarter systems and decentralized applications.</p>
